## Importing packages

In this chapter, we will use the package tidyverse. 

So by loading tidyverse, the following packages will be loaded: ggplot2, tibble, tidyr, readr, purrr, and dplyr.

Also Weâ€™ll illustrate the key ideas using data from the **nycflights13** package. The data called **filghts** is data frame contains all 336,776 flights that departed from New York City in 2013. The data comes from the US Bureau of Transportation Statistics.


```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(nycflights13)
```

## Take a first look at the data

```{r}
